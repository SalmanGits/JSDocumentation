          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: <br />
            <span>
              >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");</span

            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your

          <p class="p5">
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules. <br />
            <br />A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore
            (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
            (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
            characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
            through "z" (lowercase). <br />
            <br />You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            With the keyword var. For example, <br />
            <br />
            <span> var x = 42. </span> <br />
            <br />
            By simply assigning it a value. For example, <br />
            <br />
            <span> x = 42.</span> <br />
            <br />
            With the keyword let. For example,<br />
            <br />
            <span>let y = 13.</span> <br />
            <br />
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.

          <p class="p7">
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function. <br />
            <br />
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement. <br />
            <br />
            <span>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</span> <br />
            <br />
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015. <br />
            <br />
            <span
              >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
              not defined</span
            >

        <br />
        <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
          <h1 class="h9">Function declarations</h1>
          <p class="p8">
            A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
            function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>
          <br />
          <span>function square(number) { return number * number; }</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function. <br />
          <br />
          <span>return number * number;</span> <br />
          <br />
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
          changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
          globally or in the calling function.
